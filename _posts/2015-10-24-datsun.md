With a grand total of six parking tickets this Datsun F10 will have been towed by the City of San Francisco by the time these photos are live. The blankets in the back and the firewood on the roof suggest the owner was about to leave town. Clearly their plans changed. The F10 was Nissan's first-ever front-wheel-drive car to be sold in the US. The faded yellow paint and aging vinyl wood graphics on this example are a look earned only by decades of street-parking. You can't fake that stuff.
